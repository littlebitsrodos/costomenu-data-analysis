# Walkthrough: Costo.menu Data Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview
We successfully transformed raw Excel customer data into actionable insights, ready for CRM import and executive presentation. This walkthrough documents the cleaning process, key metrics, and the final dashboard.

## 1. Data Cleaning
**Script:** `clean_and_analyze.py`
- **Header Correction:** Identified the actual header row (Index 1) to resolve column naming issues.
- **Column Renaming:** Mapped cryptic Excel headers to clear names (`User ID`, `Email`, `License Status`, etc.).
- **Missing Value Handling:**
  - `Phone` → "N/A"
  - `Company` → "Unknown"
  - Numeric fields → 0 (for safer calculations)
- **Derived Metrics:**
  - `Days Since Last Activity`: Calculated from 'Last active date' to today.
  - `Customer Lifetime Value`: Placeholder calculation based on `Total payments amount`.
- **Output:** `cleaned_costo_menu.csv` (Ready for CRM import).

## 2. Key Insights for the CEO
| Question | Insight / Finding |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Whales vs. Minnows** | Top revenue comes from a small segment. The "Top 5 Customers" table in the dashboard highlights these VIPs. |
| **Engagement Risk** | The "Days Since Last Activity" histogram identifies dormant users who may need re-engagement campaigns. |
| **License Health** | The "Active Licenses" metric and pie chart show the immediate health of the recurring revenue base. |
| **Revenue Growth** | The "Revenue by Registration Month" chart visualizes acquisition quality trends over time. |

## 3. Dashboard Prototype (Refined)
**File:** `dashboard_app.py`
A polished Streamlit application tailored for executive presentation, updated with deep-dive analytics.

### New Features (v1.1)
- **Monthly Registrations:** A clear bar chart tracking new user signups per month to visualize acquisition trends.
- **Educational Layer (v1.8):** Added definitions (e.g., "What is Cohort LTV?") and "How to think about this graph" sections to interpret the data for non-technical stakeholders.
- **Startling Value Matrix (v1.7):** A scatter plot mapping Usage vs. Revenue. It visually exposes the "Freeloaders" (High usage, €0) vs. the rare "Power Users" (High Usage, High €).
- **Revenue by Cohort (v1.4):** A yearly breakdown showing the total lifetime revenue generated by users registered in each year, revealing the long-term value of vintage cohorts.
- **Strategic Actions (v1.2):** Specific, actionable recommendations (e.g., "Segment CRM", "Fix Login Tracking") displayed directly on the dashboard for executive visibility.
- **VIP Deep Dive:** Expanded the "Top Customers" section into a fully interactive table with contact info and activity data for the top 50 high-value users.
- **CEO Questions (v1.5):** A provocative "Questions for the CEO" section challenging the business model (e.g., "Business vs. Hobby?", "The Delete Test").

### How to Run
```bash
streamlit run dashboard_app.py
```

### Verification
